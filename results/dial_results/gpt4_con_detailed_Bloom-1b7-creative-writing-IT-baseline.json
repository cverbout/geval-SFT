Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home.\n#Person2#: I don't think it can be avoided, to be honest.\n#Person1#: perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work.\n#Person2#: I think it's something that I'll have to consider. The public transport system is pretty good.\n#Person1#: It would be better for the environment, too.\n#Person2#: I know. I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city.\n#Person1#: Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well.\n#Person2#: The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car.\n#Person1#: Well, when it's nicer outside, you can start biking to work. That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides.\n#Person2#: That's true. I could certainly use the exercise!\n#Person1#: So, are you going to quit driving to work then?\n#Person2#: Yes, it's not good for me or for the environment.</s> Summary: \n\nSummary: \n\nHi all, just looking for recommendations of online coursers for somebody like me, that is passionate about learning and wants to get into the wonderful world of online learning. I know that sounds redundant and obvious but I just want to share it, and let you all know that I am here to help out anyone that is interested in learning more about computers and internetworking. I run a Discord server for writers and want to practice my writing skills there, but the server isn't too active.\n\nAre there any other options available that are not just online coursers? I would teach concepts on \"writing short\" and \"short story writing\" which has different structures from long form writing.\n\nThe Discord server itself is just a place for writers to hang out and chat with other writers, and we also have weekly events like flash fiction and worldbuilding prompts.\n\nIf you're interested in either the creative writing lessons or the Discord server, drop a comment here or send me a message!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\n\nEvaluation Form (Avoid using words and letters.

All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage, where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.\n#Person1#: Geez. Is that all?\n#Person2#: Almost, the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis. Here you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow and profits. After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment!\n#Person1#: Umm.
