Read the dialogue carefully and identify the main topic and key points. \n2. Read the summary and compare it to the dialogue. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it presents them in a clear and logical order. \n3. Assign a score for coherence on a scale of 1 to 3, where 1 is the lowest and 3 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criteria. \n\nExample: \nDialogue: Condense the essence of this conversation into a summary: #Person1#: What makes you think you are able to do the job?\n#Person2#: My major is Automobile Designing and I have received my master's degree in science.
