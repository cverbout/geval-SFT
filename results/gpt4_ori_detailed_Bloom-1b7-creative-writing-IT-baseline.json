Having done some research I\u2019ve seen a few horror stories regarding ownership rights etc. I\u2019m very new to this, so why not ask the experts? Thanks in advance. All responses are appreciated :)xoxo\n\nEDIT: Just to let you all know, I\u2019ve been a writing/reading group for a few months now. I\u2019m a graduate in philosophy, so I have a certain amount of knowledge about what it is to be written about. However, I have never been one to share my work because I feel like this is something that only experts can really understand. I\u2019m trying to get into this business to build a website and showcase my work, so I can give a link to potential employers to show I am serious about writing and dedicated and (kind of?!) published. But I have been really struggling to find a good way to present my work because I feel like I wasted a lot of time on this.
