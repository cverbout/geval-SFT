He has devised a procedure that can detect if a substance is present in a sample. To that end, he used two different methods, sample A and sample B. Sample A was used to detect if a substance was present, but sample B was used to detect if a substance was not present. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he used two different methods, sample A and sample B. In case B, he used one method, sample A. Question: Which test would have higher sensitivity, case A or case B? Answer: case A. Question: Which test would have higher specificity, case A or case B? Answer: case B. Question: Which test would have lower sensitivity, case A or case B? Answer: case A.
