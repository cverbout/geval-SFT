I think it's the hottest day yet. I want to get out of the matrix. I want to find a place outside of the city. I want to go for a run. I want to find a friend and shake his hand.

Okay, I gotta ask, how do I avoid loneliness? I wrote this poem about loneliness, and I hope you might find some of these ideas helpful.
