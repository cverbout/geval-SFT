Evaluation Criteria:  Consistency (1-3)
 - the factual alignment between the summary and the summarized source. A factually consistent summary contains only statements that are entailed by the source dialogue. Annotators were also asked to penalize summaries that contained hallucinated facts. 

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the dialogue carefully and identify the main facts and details it presents.
2. Read the summary and compare it to the dialogue. Check if the summary contains any factual errors that are not supported by the article.
3. Assign a score for consistency based on the Evaluation Criteria.
